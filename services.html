	<h3>Furniture Conservation and restoration by accredited conservation workshop </h3>

	<p> We are often asked the difference between furniture restoration and conservation, the reality is that many objects require a degree of both approaches and although conservators have a different methods to that employed in traditional furniture restoration, it is not uncommon to find furniture and interior joinery which has suffered so badly from poor storage, previous repair or extensive historical loss or damage that restoration is a more accurate description of the treatment required. Fire damaged furniture and water damaged furniture can require restoration of veneers, joints and substrates in addition to polishing to remove more obvious water or smoke damage. <br /> <br />
	
	Careful restoration based on a conservation approach aims to replace losses and recreate original surface finishes that reflect the craftsmanâ€™s intention and retain the signs of use and age which are such an important part of the objects history. <br /> <br />

	<h3> Conservation and restoration of decorative interior woodwork </h3>
	
	<p> Historic Interiors

In addition to the restoration and conservation of period furniture we undertake related services for historic interiors. <br /> <br />

Interior Joinery restoration and conservation projects such as the gallery panelling to the chapel at Chatsworth and fine interior joinery at Belvoir castle require a diverse skill set. Alterations and the installation of modern services cause damage to panelling and joinery; this is often in addition to UV damage to surfaces and the more common problems caused by changes in humidity and the accumulation of minor damages. <br /> <br />

Listed Buildings <br />
We provide Conservation and restoration of 16th Century, 17th Century, 18th Century, and 19th Century panelled rooms, staircases and architectural woodwork which are protected by grade 2 grade 1 and grade 1* Listing.</p>
